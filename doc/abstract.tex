\begin{abstract}

Astronomical mega-surveys are creating a large volume of data, creating new
challenges regarding data management and archiving. Data mining techniques are
needed to make use this data deluge. The use of Relational Dabase Management
Systems (RDBMS) for management and data access in large surveys is explored in
this study. The \starlight catalog is imported into a RDBMS, using {\em CasJobs}
for data access. This data is produced feeding about $1\,000\,000$ galaxy
spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\SDSS) and a set of simple stellar
populations to \starlight, yielding a catalog of physical properties of those
galaxies. This analysis is based entirely on data from the optical spectrum,
serving as a benchmark for studies in new wavelengths. The Galaxy Evolution
Explorer (\galex) latest data release (GR6) includes a crossmatch between GALEX
and SDSS catalogs. Data from \starlight is then matched to GALEX, adding
ultraviolet photometry to the \starlight catalog. As a case study, a
redshift-limited sample is taken from this new catalog, galaxies are classified
based on the WHAN diagram, and the phyisical properties for each class is
analyzed against their ultraviolet colours.
